# SketchExportTemplate

This is a plugin for Sketch that allows you to add a variety of export options with a single command. For example, if you are designing for iOS, you will want to export everything in three sizes (`@1x`, `@2x`, and `@3x`). This plugin makes it so that you don't have to manually add and configure all three exports every time you want to slice an asset.

Currently the export options are only configurable through editing the plugin script itself. The plugin comes default with iOS and Android sizes, and assumes you are working in a resolution corresponding to `@2x` on iOS and `xhdpi` on Android.
